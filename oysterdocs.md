# King Oyster 
## Bot logs
Code logs are important things among developers. Since I'm not using github this time around (bc I don't need it for hosting and I'm lazy), I'll be outlining the different versions of the bot with all changes made along the way here. 

###  v0.1.05 
- üêõ **Bug:** Bot doesn't reply to messages send in replies to others
- üìö **Libraries:** Google authentication renewal
- ‚ú® **Feature:** Bot reacts to keywords, `@ everyone` messages (based on channel), attachments (also based on channel), and etc. 
- ‚ú® **Feature:** King oyster can now detect haikus (not perfect with syllable counting‚Ä¶ it's just a bot afterall ;-; ). Just type a haiku and it'll jump at you if it detects it.

###  v0.1.06:
- ‚ú® **Feature:** Syllable counter (count syllables for any poem when prompted), to try out reply to a message and say `@King Oyster#0093 count syllables`
- ‚ú® **Feature:** Generate QR code, to try out use slash command or type `qr https://example.com SCALE COLOR-HEX BG-COLOR-HEX` (you can leave anything after the link out of it if you want to)
- ~~**Feature:** Add new creative resources to King Oyster~~ ***Bad Idea*** ‚ùå (would need constant updates)
- ‚ú® **Feature *Update:*** Improve the inspirator, figured there's no use for the adverb in there. Use through `/inspire` command or type `@King Oyster#0093 give me some inspiration` (keywords: `inspire`, `inspiration`)

## src/ index.js
The heart of King Oyster, the main breain‚Äî this file contains main code for bot. 
This file includes Google authentication, working with Google Drive & Spreadhseets, imports dependencies, sets bot status, connects to `quotes.txt` file, listens to interactions and created messages.
TODO link google authentication site & .env
TODO link Node Packages 

## src/ quotes.txt
Lists quotes to be used in `index.js`.
See `/quote` slash command.
TODO link command

## src/ register-commands.js
Registers slash commands.
Run the following command _once_ to register commands with a server:
```curl

```
Make sure to adjust the server ID in `.env` file.
See Slash Commands section for more info on slash commands.
TODO link slash commands

## .env
Contains all secrets. 
This file contains:
- `TOKEN`: The bot token, aka the Oyster's password.
- `GUILD_ID`: The Discord server ID. Useful when registering slash commands with a new server.
- `CLIENT_ID`: Oyster's user ID, not very important and I probably don't use.

- `DRIVE_CLIENT_ID`: Google authentication client ID. 
- `DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Google authentication secret, aka the password for the authentication process.
- `DRIVE_REDIRECT_URI`: Redirecting URI to authentication link for handling API request
- `DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN`: Authentication token. May need to refresh after updating bot. See [src/index.js](##src/index.js) TODO link here
- `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`: ID for google drive folder. We don't use this one really in the code‚Äì but might be useful in later versions. ID derived from directory url.
- `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_1`: **Writing** submissions folder ID; derived from directory url.
- `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_2`: **Visual** submissions folder ID; derived from directory url.
- `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_3`: **Audio** submissions folder ID; derived from directory url.
- `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_4`: **Video** submissions folder ID; derived from directory url.
- `DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_5`: **Other** submissions folder ID; derived from directory url.
- `SPREADSHEET_ID`: Spreadsheet file ID, used for information on room number, meeting times, office hours, deadline, etc. Derived from spreadsheet url.

## package.json & package-lock.json files + node_modules directory
`package.json` contains version number of dependencies, while `package-lock.json` includes more info on packages used, connecting back to `node_modules` directory, which includes all the packages used in the project.
